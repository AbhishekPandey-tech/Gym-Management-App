                Gym Management App   
                                                                        

Variety of occasions turns up when we visit various gym. The difficulty we find is the availability of staffs, gym seats etc. the problem becomes more tedious when the organisation is very big or during the rush seasons.
And it is very time consuming and difficult to maintain the records of gym.
This situation calls for an automated app for managing the system which not only regulate the gym but also keep manual intervention to minimum. Our proposed app will regulate the management of each individual by their login Ids.   
  
Existing System
The existing system consists of many disadvantages. The system is physically handled using the pen paper-based model.
The gym manager has to maintain a record of all things like members, staffs, new members etc.
There is a probability of damaging the recorded dairy.
The manager has no idea of seats whether the seats are full or not.
financial safety is less as compared to the paper-based model.

Proposed System
The app will provide many new features to the admin like adding new members ,Fetching the member details, date of joining, BMI and fat percentage calculators, plans of workout, diet and attendance.
*Admin will know the status of gym seats.
*Validations of admin in app by using login/signup features via mail as well as phone numbers.
* making the diet plan is easy and take less time as the presence of B.M.I and fat percentage calculator.
*portability is very easy and convenient.
